# About Me

Hi! My name is Clara. I'm a junior at East Brunswick High School in New Jersey. In my free time, I enjoy playing tennis, the guitar, piano, and drawing! I run an instagram for my bullet journal where I share my art and productivity/lifestyle tips, and recently I opened a small business - an etsy sticker shop!

### Etsy Sticker Shop: <br/>
*With my strong passion in digital art, I decided to use my skills and start a small business selling stickers on etsy. My shop, Bucket of Stickers, can be found at bucketofstickers.etsy.com. I recently listed a new item of 3 stickers with Black Lives Matter designs, where 100% of net proceeds will be donated to Campaign Zero, a platform aiming to find effective solutions to end police violence. So far, I have raised $400!!*<br/>
