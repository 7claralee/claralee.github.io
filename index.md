# About Me

Hi! My name is Clara. I'm a junior at East Brunswick High School in New Jersey. In my free time, I enjoy playing tennis, the guitar, piano, and drawing! I run an instagram for my bullet journal where I share my art and productivity/lifestyle tips, and recently I opened a small business - an etsy sticker shop!
